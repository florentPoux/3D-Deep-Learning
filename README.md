## Introduction <a name="introduction"></a>

Deep learning in 3D space has gained significant traction in various fields, including geospatial mapping, medical imaging, computer vision, robotics, autonomous driving, and more. This repository serves as a code learning hub for understanding and implementing 3D deep learning techniques using Python.

## Getting Started <a name="getting-started"></a>

Before diving into the tutorials, make sure you have the necessary tools and libraries installed. Please refer to the [Installation](#installation) section for detailed instructions.

## Installation <a name="installation"></a>

To get started with 3D Deep Learning, you'll need to set up your environment. Each code package is grounded with an how-to guide accessible on my [Medium Page](https://medium.com/@florentpoux). You then have a section dedicated to the local setup.
It usually involves this:

```bash
# Clone the repository
git clone https://github.com/username/3d-deep-learning.git

# Navigate to the project directory
cd 3d-deep-learning

# Install miniconda with Python version 3.10

# Create a virtual environment (optional but recommended)
conda create -n DEEPTUTO python=3.10

# Activate the virtual environment
conda acti

# Install dependencies using requirements (if set-up)
pip install -r requirements.txt

#Install dependencies using the given libraries in the Medium Article
pip install numpy matplotlib laspy keras
```
